                <li>It is the coldest, driest, windiest, and highest continent on Earth, with an average elevation higher than any other continent due to its massive ice sheet.</li>
                <li>The continent is situated almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean; it contains the geographic South Pole.</li>
                <li>Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet averaging 1.9 kilometers (1.2 miles) thick, which holds about 60‚Äì90% of the world‚Äôs freshwater reserves.</li>

                <li>The highest peak in Antarctica is Mount Vinson, rising to 4,892 meters (16,050 feet).</li>
                <li>Antarctica is a true polar desert, with annual precipitation averaging less than 200 millimeters (8 inches) near the coast and much less inland.</li>
                <li>There are no indigenous human inhabitants; only scientific researchers and support staff live temporarily at over 50 research stations scattered across the continent.</li>
                <li>Despite the harsh environment, Antarctica supports unique wildlife such as penguins, seals, mites, nematodes, and specialized mosses and lichens, and its surrounding oceans are biologically rich.</li>

                <li>Oceania is the smallest continent by land area and is composed mainly of islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean, including Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and numerous island nations and territories.</li>
                <li>As of 2025, Oceania's population is approximately 46.6 million people, making it the second-least populated continent after Antarctica.</li>
                <li>Australia dominates Oceania in size and population, accounting for over 57% of the continent‚Äôs population (about 27 million) and more than 90% of its land area.</li>
                <li>The region includes thousands of islands grouped into major subregions: Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, and Australasia.</li>
                <li>Papua New Guinea and New Zealand are the next largest countries by both area and population, with around 10.8 million and 5.3 million inhabitants respectively.</li>
                <li>The majority of Oceania's area is sparsely populated; several island nations, including Nauru and Tuvalu, have populations under 20,000.</li>
                <li>Oceania is geographically and culturally diverse, with indigenous peoples maintaining unique traditions, languages, and art across the Pacific islands.</li>
                <li>Christianity is the predominant religion, with about 74.6% of the population identifying as Christian, followed by minorities who are religiously unaffiliated or adhere to other religions.</li>

      <h3>MAJOR TYPES OF POLLUTION:</h3>
      <p>Air Pollution: Contamination of the atmosphere by harmful gases and particulate matter from sources like industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, burning of fossil fuels, and agricultural activities. It leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, acid rain, and global warming.</p>
      <p>Water Pollution: The contamination of rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater by industrial effluents, sewage, agricultural runoff (fertilizers and pesticides), oil spills, and marine dumping. It harms aquatic life, disrupts ecosystems, and poses health risks to humans.</p>
      <p>Soil Pollution: Occurs when soil is contaminated by industrial waste, pesticides, heavy metals, plastics, and improper disposal of hazardous chemicals. Soil pollution reduces fertility, contaminates food crops, and impacts food security and health.</p>
      <p>Noise Pollution: Excessive noise from traffic, industrial machinery, construction, and loudspeakers affects human health by causing stress, hearing loss, and disruption of daily life.</p>
